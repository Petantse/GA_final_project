									Bloom VLE (Virtual Learning Environment) is an ongoing project carried out by the Research &amp; Development team at CoSector,
									University of London. Bloom is a service based on the open-source e-learning system Moodle. As an open-source
									software, Moodle offers the freedom to customise and adapt it to every possible need. However, as we found this freedom
									comes with the price of overall poor user experience.
								</p>
								<p class="cover-text">
									Our goal as a team was to create a user-centered VLE solution which provides relevant functionality, consistent look and feel,
									and positive user experience out-of-the-box.
								</p>
								<p class="cover-text">
									The discovery phase of the project started with undertaking an extensive market and user research. It included conducting over
									200 surveys and 30 interviews (one-to-one sessions and focus groups) with students, lecturers, learning technologists and
									administrators. The research outputs were collated and used for building user personas, user journeys, design guidelines,
									MVP and future development goals. Low and high fidelity prototypes were built and then tested with 20 students.

										<p class="insection-text">
											The figures above were acquired from the surveys conducted. As it can be seen, not surprisingly, the most common activities
											students perform are submitting assignments followed by downloading/accessing course materials and receiving their grades.
											The percentage of students who reported using the VLE for other tasks plunges to 12% and less. Some of these are: contacting
											friends/tutors (12%), collaboration (12%) and downloading/watching recorded lectures (6%).
										</p>

									<li class="text-thumb">
										<h3 class="thumb-title">Accessing and submitting assignments</h3>
										<p class="insection-text">
											Despite this being the most important task students complete within the VLE it is associated with a variety of serious issues. Many students reported that the system is too slow when processing uploads and system feedback is not clear enough. For example,  no upload progress indication and confusion around whether the submission was successful or not. Other issues include finding assignments is too complicated and deadline reminders are not correct or confusing. Some students talked about missing deadlines or submitting twice due to the poor notification system.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="text-thumb">
										<h3 class="thumb-title">Accessing grades and feedback</h3>
										<p class="insection-text">
											There isn't a single instance where students can easily find all of their grades. The journey to finding a grade in the VLE was described as a complicated task that feels very similar to physically going to a department in the university. Additionally, some lecturers said that many times students can't find their feedback and complain about not receiving any.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="text-thumb">
										<h3 class="thumb-title">Navigation and clutter</h3>
										<p class="insection-text">
											Students generally have high expectations when it comes to technology, being exposed to different software platforms on a daily basis. They expect to find what they need quickly and easily. However, this could be quite a challenge in Moodle. The system is clunky, cluttered and the navigation is complicated and confusing. Searching for a specific thing involves too many clicks, endless scrolling and wandering through too many pages.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="text-thumb">
										<h3 class="thumb-title">Accessing course materials</h3>
										<p class="insection-text">
											We found similar issues based on the complicated site navigation. However, students also report they find it frustrating that course pages look very different to each other and even inconsistent. A need for a clearer pattern of how information is presented was expressed.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="text-thumb">
										<h3 class="thumb-title">Inconsistency of lecturer usage</h3>
										<p class="insection-text">
											Lecturers' usage of the VLE greatly influences the overall student experience and satisfaction. Many students reported that they are not happy about the fact that some lecturers don't use Moodle enough, don't know how to use it or even refuse using it at all.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li class="text-thumb">
										<h3 class="thumb-title">Look and feel</h3>
										<p class="insection-text">
											Last, but not least, generally no one likes how the system looks like. The majority of users interviewed feel like it looks very old fashioned, clunky and boring.

												Sam is very digitally literate, using programmes such as Premier, Final cut, Photoshop regularly, as well as Instagram and other social media to promote his work. However, it took a long time to get familiar with Moodle. Now he’s used to it and it’s fine. He uses college computers as well as personal devices and access to multimedia files is very important.

												As an MA distance learning student, access to Moodle is vital; the whole course is structured around it. Working in a refugee camp means internet access is intermittent, so being able to work offline and find information quickly and easily when she can log-on is vital. Communication tools are also key- this includes discussions with classmates via forums and feedback on essays from tutors.

												As a BTEC IT student, Martin uses Moodle regularly to look at course materials and upload work. He uses it when the teacher has posted something, or at a deadline/exam. He is guided by the teacher’s content. The navigation can be difficult and the high volume of content means lots of scrolling and it is easy to get lost or forget what he is looking for.
